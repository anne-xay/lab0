For launch.c, I used the skeleton/lab1 outline. I made a few changes/corrections to it such as when child is greater than 0, I print the pid f the child on stderr, waitpid on it, then print the child status.I wass getting incorrect address errors in launch.c, but now it is running correctly. For tube.c, it is independent of launch.c, however it uses some of the same code from it. Made two buffers to store the cmd args. The first attempt at tube.c was all over the place, had to reorganize the structure of the program. Had to seperate the two forks instead of having the two forks sequentially after each other cause that means the first child will also fork meaning my program is making 3 children.
